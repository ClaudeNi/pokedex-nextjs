# Project
A Pokedex for 151 pokemon (generation 1) where you can click on a Pokemon and view its base stats.
By using:
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- TypeScript
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
I was able to build the site and make it responsive.

In the main menu we have all 151 Pokemon from generation 1 loaded and clicking on them moves you to the Pokemon page to view their details.

The Pokemon page shows base details of the Pokemon with its picture and id.
